   ❯❯❱ dockerfile.security.missing-user.missing-user
          By not specifying a USER, a program in the container may run as 'root'. This is a security hazard.
          If an attacker can control a process running as root, they may have control over the container.   
          Ensure that the last USER in a Dockerfile is a USER other than 'root'.

          Checks for setting the environment variable NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED to 0, which disables TLS   
          verification. This should only be used for debugging purposes. Setting the option rejectUnauthorized
          to false bypasses verification against the list of trusted CAs, which also leads to insecure        
          transport. These options lead to vulnerability to MTM attacks, and should not be used.
